          <h5>INVESTMENT PRODUCTS</h5>
          <p>The price of securities can and does fluctuate, and any individual security may experience upward or   downward movements, and may even become valueless. There is an inherent risk that losses may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling securities.</p>
          <p>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or options can be substantial. In some circumstances, you may sustain losses in excess of your initial margin funds. Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily achieve the desired results. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. You may be called upon at short notice to deposit additional margin funds. If the required funds are not provided within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated. You will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account. You should therefore study and understand futures contracts and options before you trade and carefully consider whether such trading is suitable in the light of your own investment objectives, financial circumstances, tolerance to risks and investment experience.</p>
          <p>You should also read any risk disclosure statement contained in any  particular investment product you intend to purchase, subscribe or trade. If in doubt, please seek specific professional advice.</p>
          <h5>INDEMNITY</h5>
          <p>YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND TO KEEP THE BANK FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY INDEMNIFIED AGAINST ANY ACTION, LIABILITY, COST, CLAIM, LOSS, DAMAGE, PROCEEDING OR EXPENSE (INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES ON A  FULL INDEMNITY BASIS) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY THE BANK ARISING FROM OR WHICH IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO:</p>
          <h5>TERMINATION</h5>
          <p>The Bank may terminate these terms and conditions, your access to this Web Site and use of online services at any time, without prior notice to you.</p>
          <h5>MODIFICATION</h5>
          <p>The Bank reserves the right in its discretion to change at any time without prior warning or notice any information or material contained on this Web Site and is entitled to from time to time amend the terms and conditions under which this Web Site is used with prior notice to you.
